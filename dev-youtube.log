    '[00:00] Is fame a worthwhile goal?',
    "[00:03] Uh, it gets you invited to better parties. Gets you into better restaurants. Uh, fame. So fame is this funny thing where a lot of people know you but you don't know them. And, uh, it does get you put on a pedestal. Uh, it can get you what you want, uh, at a, at a distance. So I wouldn't say it's worthless. Obviously, people want it for a reason.",
    "[00:26] Um, it's high status, so it attracts the opposite sex. Uh, especially for men, it attracts women. Uh, that said it is high cost. It means you have no privacy. Um, you do have weirdos and lunatics. Uh, you do get hit up a lot for weird things. Uh, and you're on a stage. So you're forced to perform. So you're forced to be consistent with your past proclamations and actions and you're going to have haters and all that nonsense.",
    "[00:46] But the fact that we do it, the fact that we all seem to want it, means that it would be disingenuous to say, oh, no, no, I'm famous, but you don't want to be famous.",
    "[01:10] Fame for fame's sake.",
    "[01:12] Yeah, exactly. So it's better that it's earned fame. Uh, so, for example, earned respect in the tribe is you do things that are good for the tribe. Uh, who are the most famous people in human history?",
    "[01:24] Uh, they're, uh, you know, they're, they're people who sort of transcended the self, the Buddhas and the Jesus's and the Muhammads of the world. Who else is famous? Uh, the artists are famous, you know, art lasts for a long time, the scientists are famous, they discover things, the conquerors are famous, presumably because they conquered for their tribe. There was someone that they were fighting for.",
    '[01:43] So generally, the higher up you rise by doing things for greater and greater groups of people, even though it may be considered tyrannical or negative, like I, you know, Genghis Khan is famous, but, uh, to the Mongols, he was doing good, to the rest of them, not so much. Uh,',
    "[02:08] The higher level you're operating at, the more people you're taking care of, the more you sort of earn respect and fame. And I think those are good reasons to be famous. If if fame is empty, if you're famous just because your name showed up in a lot of places or your face showed up in a lot of places, then that's a hollow fame. And I think deep down you will know that and so it'll be fragile and you'll always be afraid of losing it and then you'll be forced to perform.",
    "[02:32] There's a challenge, I think, especially if people make very loud public proclamations about things. You mentioned there about, um, you're almost a hostage to the things that you used to say, that, um, being able to update your opinions and change your mind looks very similar to the Internet as hypocrisy does.",
    "[02:53] You know, the difference between me saying something in the past and saying something different now is perhaps I've learned, perhaps I've updated my beliefs. But so few people do it in a legitimate way. I think that the Grifter shill, you see, this is the, the, the, the smoking gun that shows that he didn't really believe that thing all along.",
    '[03:10] And, uh, yeah, I, I went to a retreat in LA a couple of years ago, and there was a guy that I used to follow, a big, um, business and productivity advice content creator, really, really successful, and he just totally stepped back from everything, went, uh, like monk mode and focused on his business. I asked him why, and he said, uh,',
    '[03:29] I started feeling like I had to live up to in private the things that I was saying in public.',
    "[03:34] Right. Yeah, it's a, it's a, what was it, the, uh, who said it was Mencken that a, um, foolish consistency is a hobgoblin of little minds, right? Um, but essentially, look, all life is all learning is error correction, right? Every knowledge creation system works through correcting errors, making guesses and correcting errors. So by definition, if you're learning, you're going to be wrong most of the time.",
    "[03:55] And you're going to be updating your priors. And so, for example, I did this Joe Rogan podcast. I know it's like eight or nine years ago. Um, and people will call out like the one thing that didn't turn out to be correct, right? And it's just like, and they just beat on it because it, it helps them in their mind raise their status a little bit. Aha, I caught him in an error. Well, I think if you catch someone in a blatant lie where there's believe one thing and they say another, that's legitimate, that's a character flaw. They shouldn't be lying.",
    "[04:21] But on the other hand, if they just made a guess at something and they got it wrong, and by the way, mostly it's about the AGI thing, and I think I'm still right about that. That's a different story. Um, people who think we have achieved AGI just failed a touring test from their side.",
    "[04:35] But, uh, it's funny how people latch onto single proclamations, but the reality is all of us are dynamical systems. We're always changing, we're always learning, we're always growing, and, uh, hopefully we're correcting errors. What you don't want to be doing is lying in public so that because you're, you're trying to look good. And I think people can smell that.",
    "[05:10] Uh, bullshit radars have become hyper-sensitized to try and work out whether or not this person means the thing that they're saying.",
    '[05:18] Yeah. I mean, they they a lot of people are wrong. Most of us are wrong most of the time, especially in any new endeavor, any, you know, being wrong and disingenuous, though, purposefully wrong.',
    "[05:27] Correct. Exactly. So I think I think that's the big difference. Is someone is wrong, no big deal, as long as they have a genuine reason for saying what they're saying or believing what they're believing. But if they are lying to elevate their status or their appearance or to live up to some expectation, that's the mistake, and that's a mistake not just for the listener, it's a mistake for themselves, because then you're going to get trapped in a hall of mirrors. You yourself are going to be consistent with your past proclamations. So if you're lying to others, you're going to be lying to yourself.",
    "[05:51] Yeah, you're puppeted by a person that you are not even.",
    "[05:54] That's right. Yeah. It's, it's like, what was that line? There's you're, you're basically trying to impress people who, you know, don't care about you.",
    "[06:05] They don't like the real you, and if they saw the real you, they wouldn't care. And the people who would like the real you don't get to see the real you, so they pass you by.",
    "[06:11] Right. You only want the respect of the very, very few people that you respect. Uh, trying to demand respect from the masses is a fool's errand. If you struggle to stay asleep because your body gets too hot or too cold, this is going to help. Just add an Eight Sleep Pod Four Ultra to your mattress like a fitted sheet, and it will automatically cool down or warm up each side of your bed up to 20 degrees. It's got integrated sensors that track your sleep time, your sleep phases, your HRV, your snoring, and your heart rate with 99% accuracy. And it even starts cooling or heating your bed an hour before you get into it. That is why Eight Sleep has been clinically proven to increase total sleep up to one hour every night. Best of all, they've got a 30-day sleep trial. So you can buy it and sleep on it for 29 nights, and if you don't like it, they will give you your money back. Plus, they ship internationally. Right now, you can get $350 off the Pod Four Ultra by going to the link in the description below or heading to EightSleep.com/modernwisdom and using the code modernwisdom at checkout. That's E I G H T S L E E P dot com slash modernwisdom and modernwisdom at checkout. Thank you very much for tuning in. If you enjoyed that clip with Naval, just a a mere taster, the full-length episode is available right here. Go on. Watch it. Play."

    '[00:00] Is fame a worthwhile goal?',
    "[00:03] Uh, it gets you invited to better parties. Gets you into better restaurants. Uh, fame. So fame is this funny thing where a lot of people know you but you don't know them. And, uh, it does get you put on a pedestal. Uh, it can get you what you want, uh, at a, at a distance. So I wouldn't say it's worthless. Obviously, people want it for a reason.",
    "[00:26] Um, it's high status, so it attracts the opposite sex. Uh, especially for men, it attracts women. Uh, that said it is high cost. It means you have no privacy. Um, you do have weirdos and lunatics. Uh, you do get hit up a lot for weird things. Uh, and you're on a stage. So you're forced to perform. So you're forced to be consistent with your past proclamations and actions and you're going to have haters and all that nonsense.",
    "[00:46] But the fact that we do it, the fact that we all seem to want it, means that it would be disingenuous to say, oh, no, no, I'm famous, but you don't want to be famous.",
    "[01:10] Fame for fame's sake.",
    "[01:12] Yeah, exactly. So it's better that it's earned fame. Uh, so, for example, earned respect in the tribe is you do things that are good for the tribe. Uh, who are the most famous people in human history?",
    "[01:24] Uh, they're, uh, you know, they're, they're people who sort of transcended the self, the Buddhas and the Jesus's and the Muhammads of the world. Who else is famous? Uh, the artists are famous, you know, art lasts for a long time, the scientists are famous, they discover things, the conquerors are famous, presumably because they conquered for their tribe. There was someone that they were fighting for.",
    '[01:43] So generally, the higher up you rise by doing things for greater and greater groups of people, even though it may be considered tyrannical or negative, like I, you know, Genghis Khan is famous, but, uh, to the Mongols, he was doing good, to the rest of them, not so much. Uh,',
    "[02:08] The higher level you're operating at, the more people you're taking care of, the more you sort of earn respect and fame. And I think those are good reasons to be famous. If if fame is empty, if you're famous just because your name showed up in a lot of places or your face showed up in a lot of places, then that's a hollow fame. And I think deep down you will know that and so it'll be fragile and you'll always be afraid of losing it and then you'll be forced to perform.",
    "[02:32] There's a challenge, I think, especially if people make very loud public proclamations about things. You mentioned there about, um, you're almost a hostage to the things that you used to say, that, um, being able to update your opinions and change your mind looks very similar to the Internet as hypocrisy does.",
    "[02:53] You know, the difference between me saying something in the past and saying something different now is perhaps I've learned, perhaps I've updated my beliefs. But so few people do it in a legitimate way. I think that the Grifter shill, you see, this is the, the, the, the smoking gun that shows that he didn't really believe that thing all along.",
    '[03:10] And, uh, yeah, I, I went to a retreat in LA a couple of years ago, and there was a guy that I used to follow, a big, um, business and productivity advice content creator, really, really successful, and he just totally stepped back from everything, went, uh, like monk mode and focused on his business. I asked him why, and he said, uh,',
    '[03:29] I started feeling like I had to live up to in private the things that I was saying in public.',
    "[03:34] Right. Yeah, it's a, it's a, what was it, the, um, who said it was Mencken that a, um, foolish consistency is a hobgoblin of little minds, right? Um, but essentially, look, all life is all learning is error correction, right? Every knowledge creation system works through correcting errors, making guesses and correcting errors. So by definition, if you're learning, you're going to be wrong most of the time.",
    "[03:55] And you're going to be updating your priors. And so, for example, I did this Joe Rogan podcast. I know it's like eight or nine years ago. Um, and people will call out like the one thing that didn't turn out to be correct, right? And it's just like, and they just beat on it because it, it helps them in their mind raise their status a little bit. Aha, I caught him in an error. Well, I think if you catch someone in a blatant lie where there's believe one thing and they say another, that's legitimate, that's a character flaw. They shouldn't be lying.",
    "[04:21] But on the other hand, if they just made a guess at something and they got it wrong, and by the way, mostly it's about the AGI thing, and I think I'm still right about that. That's a different story. Um, people who think we have achieved AGI just failed a touring test from their side.",
    "[04:35] But, uh, it's funny how people latch onto single proclamations, but the reality is all of us are dynamical systems. We're always changing, we're always learning, we're always growing, and, uh, hopefully we're correcting errors. What you don't want to be doing is lying in public so that because you're, you're trying to look good. And I think people can smell that.",
    "[05:10] Uh, bullshit radars have become hyper-sensitized to try and work out whether or not this person means the thing that they're saying.",
    '[05:18] Yeah. I mean, they they a lot of people are wrong. Most of us are wrong most of the time, especially in any new endeavor, any, you know, being wrong and disingenuous, though, purposefully wrong.',
    "[05:27] Correct. Exactly. So I think I think that's the big difference. Is someone is wrong, no big deal, as long as they have a genuine reason for saying what they're saying or believing what they're believing. But if they are lying to elevate their status or their appearance or to live up to some expectation, that's the mistake, and that's a mistake not just for the listener, it's a mistake for themselves, because then you're going to get trapped in a hall of mirrors. You yourself are going to be consistent with your past proclamations. So if you're lying to others, you're going to be lying to yourself.",
    "[05:51] Yeah, you're puppeted by a person that you are not even.",
    "[05:54] That's right. Yeah. It's, it's like, what was that line? There's you're, you're basically trying to impress people who, you know, don't care about you.",
    "[06:05] They don't like the real you, and if they saw the real you, they wouldn't care. And the people who would like the real you don't get to see the real you, so they pass you by.",
    "[06:11] Right. You only want the respect of the very, very few people that you respect. Uh, trying to demand respect from the masses is a fool's errand.",
    "[06:20] If you struggle to stay asleep because your body gets too hot or too cold, this is going to help. Just add an Eight Sleep Pod Four Ultra to your mattress like a fitted sheet, and it will automatically cool down or warm up each side of your bed up to 20 degrees. It's got integrated sensors that track your sleep time, your sleep phases, your HRV, your snoring, and your heart rate with 99% accuracy. And it even starts cooling or heating your bed an hour before you get into it. That is why Eight Sleep has been clinically proven to increase total sleep up to one hour every night.",
    "[06:50] Best of all, they've got a 30-day sleep trial. So you can buy it and sleep on it for 29 nights, and if you don't like it, they will give you your money back. Plus, they ship internationally. Right now, you can get $350 off the Pod Four Ultra by going to the link in the description below or heading to EightSleep.com/modernwisdom and using the code modernwisdom at checkout.
